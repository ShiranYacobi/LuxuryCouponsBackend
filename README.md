# Luxury Coupons Backend - Server side 👩🏻‍💻

Luxury Coupons Backend is a Java program, using Spring Boot Framework, Maven and MySQL DB.
It's a coupons management system, which allows companies to produce coupons,
as part of advertising campaigns, and register customers can purchase them.
Access to the system is divided into three types of clients:

1.Administrator.
2.Comapny.
3.Customer.
Each client is able to login to the system and execute specific operations.

# Installations 🔧
I've used IntelliJ IDEA for the development environment,
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows

and MySQL Workbench for DB: user name: root, password: 12345678.

For cheking the program - Download to zip, export the zip and follow the instructions:
click File -> Open -> choose pom.xml in the project folder -> OK.

# Remarks 📝
